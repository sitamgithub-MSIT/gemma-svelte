# Sveltekit-Gemma

This SvelteKit project utilizes the Groq API in OpenAI-compatible mode to access the Gemma2 9B instruction model. It is a straightforward example of leveraging the Groq API and Vercel AI SDK to create a chatbot that can interact with the large language model. The project is based on Daytona's starter AI chatbot initiative. In this version, the chatbot speaks like a pirate, thanks to our system prompt.
